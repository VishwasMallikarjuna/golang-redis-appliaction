## Introduction

This application showcases how to build a simple Go application that interacts with PostgreSQL for data storage and Redis for caching. It provides basic CRUD operations on a "users" table, demonstrating how to create, read, update, and delete user records.

## Setup

### PostgreSQL Setup

1. **Install PostgreSQL:** If you haven't already, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. **Create Database:**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database named `simple_app_db`.
   - Run the following SQL query to create a `users` table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       email VARCHAR(100)
   );

### Redis Setup

1. Make sure you have Redis installed and running. If not, you can download and install it from the Redis website.

### Go Application 

    Make sure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from here:
    
    https://go.dev/doc/install

    Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
    
    go mod tidy


go mod tidy

Ensure that PostgreSQL and Redis servers are running and accessible. You may need to customize the database connection details in the code according to your environment.

Build and run the application using the following command:

bash
### Running the Application
    go run main.go

### Configuration

    PostgreSQL connection details are provided in the format: postgres://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost/simple_app_db?sslmode=disable.
    Redis is assumed to be running on localhost with default configurations.

### Code Overview

    The application initializes connections to both PostgreSQL and Redis databases in the init() function.
    The main() function demonstrates the usage of CRUD operations on user records.
    A User struct represents a user entity in the database, containing fields for ID, Name, and Email.
    Functions are provided for CRUD operations:
        getUserWithCache(userID int) (*User, error)
        createUser(name, email string) (int, error)
        getUser(userID int) (*User, error)
        updateUserEmail(userID int, newEmail string) error
        deleteUser(userID int) error

### Operations

    Create User: Creates a new user record in the database.
    Retrieve User: Retrieves a user record from the database, with caching support.
    Update User: Updates the email address of an existing user.
    Delete User: Deletes a user record from the database.

### Notes

    This application serves as a basic example and may require enhancements for production use, such as error handling, input validation, and security measures.
